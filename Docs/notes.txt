Changes to the DB required to make our code work:

Create a Book Meta Class, and add the necessary Meta fields:
"Year"
"ISBN10"
"ISBN13"
"Grade"
"Publisher"
"Type"

This can be done through catalog import...


Add a Meta Field to Line Items called "Gratis"
This will not be stored in a catalog export...

Add a Meta Fielt to the Principal->Organization Meta Class called "BusinessPartnerState"


Cart

Create a page called Cart/view.aspx and add our custom Cart Viewer control (the "My Shopping Carts" control will point here... Adding a new item to a cart will link to here too)
Create a page called Cart/manage.aspx and add our custom Cart Manager control.

Add to the user profile part of web.config file an "ActiveCart" key.
Add to the SalePriceTypes of the ecf.catalog.config an entry for "StateGroup"

mediachase.Search.config (in the Commerce Manager AND in the frontend site)
- set search index directory
- change indexer to user our custom indexer (this helps with Grade)

searchFilters.config (in Public_Layer/FrontEnt/App_Data/)
- ass all our custom search filters

In the CMS, the appropriate templates must be added (e.g. the "Book" template)

To Discuss with Team:

- States/Districts/Schools data. Can we get a web service for this?
- On the Registration page, why is it school OR district. Why not district->school
- Active/Submitted shopping carts pages:
	- Shouldn't the status of the "submitted" carts be "submitted"?
	- We need a way from at least the "Active Carts" page to create/delete/rename carts. I suggest a footer row.
	
catalog.config in both the Admin Layer and the Public layer
add the keys for each sale type.
